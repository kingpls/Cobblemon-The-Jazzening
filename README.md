# Cobblemon - The Jazzening

The main modpack that we'll be using for the Cobblemon server.
Doesn't contain much other than Cobblemon, some add-ons, some furniture mods, and some optimization mods, so feel free to add client-side stuff as you like.

The Prisim/MCPatcher/MultiMC, Modrinth, and Curseforge versions are downloadable up above.
Reach out to me if y'all have issues downloading it :D

**I would recommend everyone to use the Regular [REG] version, but feel free to check the other versions out as well if you'd like.**

## Regular [REG]

The pack I would reccomend for general use. Should perform well on most PCs.

**I do not recommending using the following modpacks unless you know what you're doing.**

## Minimal [MIN]

The base mods needed for the pack to connect to the server, as well as optimization mods. Would only recommend this if your PC cannot handle the REG version.

## Special [SP]

The instance _I_ use on the server. Contains **everything I use on my instance of the pack, including texture packs, shaders, and debugging mods**. This version of the pack is **UNOPTIMIZED FOR THE GENERAL USER**, and I don't recommend using this unless you're okay with cleaning it up for personal use. I would recommend only using this with a good PC, **and if you know what you are doing**. **Please allocate 6GB to this pack before use.**
