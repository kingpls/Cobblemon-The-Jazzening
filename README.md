# Cobblemon - The Jazzening
The main modpack that we'll be using for the Cobblemon server.
Doesn't contain much other than Cobblemon, some add-ons, some furniture mods, and some optimization mods, so feel free to add client-side stuff as you like.

The Prisim/MCPatcher/MultiMC version will be linked down below, and the Modrinth version is downloadable up above.
The Modrinth version doesn't automatically set it to the icons I made, but they are in the extracted modpack. Feel free to set it to those if you'd like :D

I have 3 versions for y'all to choose from:

## Minimal

The base mods needed for the pack to connect to the server, as well as optimization mods. A good base, and good for lower-end PCs.

## Regular

The pack I would reccomend for general use, adding on Xaero's Minimap/World Map and some flavour mods. Probably a better base for adding stuff onto, and should perform well on run-of-the-mill PCs.

## Special

The pack with the setup *I* plan to use on the server. Contains everything the other versions do, with Complementary + Euphoria Tweaks, Distant Horizons, and resource packs I like to use preinstalled. Would recommend using this with a decent PC. **Please allocate 6GB to this pack before use.**
