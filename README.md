# Cobblemon - The Jazzening
The main modpack that we'll be using for the Cobblemon server.
Doesn't contain much other than Cobblemon, some add-ons, some furniture mods, and some optimization mods, so feel free to add client-side stuff as you like.

I have 3 versions for y'all to choose from:

## Minimal

The base mods needed for the pack to connect to the server, as well as optimization mods. A good base, and good for lower-end PCs.

## Regular [WIP]

The pack I would reccomend for general use, mostly containting [WIP]

## Special

The pack with the setup *I* plan to use on the server. Contains everything the other versions do, with Complementary + Euphoria Tweaks, Distant Horizons, and resource packs I like to use preinstalled. Would recommend using this with a decent PC. **Please allocate 6GB to this pack before use.**

If any issues arise, please let me know on Discord. Many thanks.
